// Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds a value to the group (but only if it isnâ€™t already a member), delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.

// Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine whether two values are the same.

// Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating over it.
